built by: Jeremiah
Purpose: 
    This is a personal app built to test my react skills and learn along the way

How to use:
    - cd a terminal to backend, then use the command: node server.js to run the backend server
    - cd a seperate terminal to one of the budgets, then use npm start to run 

note:
    - assumes node js is already installed
    - BudgetV1.0 runs off of an older backend layout and no longer functions

Structure:
    - The reason for multiple versions is that Im not sure when I will run out of time to keep working on this side project and I always want
    working code in case I can't finish a specific feature.
